# SanFrancisco_Crime_Rate_Analysis

Welcome to my Github. For this project, I worked with two other team members, Huimin and Leo. Our objective was to analyze a dataset captured in 2016 of crimes in 2016. After close analysis we've arrived at various insights about San Francisco's crime rates and which contributing factors are related these crimes. A full report as well as a Jupiter python file will be included.
